# Language-Detection-Model



◦ Built a text classification model to detect the language of given text inputs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

◦ Performed data preprocessing and cleaning using pandas and NumPy, including handling missing values and text normalization.

◦ Transformed text data into numerical features using CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words model) for effective machine learning training.

◦ Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict languages with over 95% accuracy on the test dataset.

◦ Implemented an interactive user input system for real-time language prediction.

Tech Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, MultinomialNB), NLP (Bag-of-Words), Supervised Machine Learning
